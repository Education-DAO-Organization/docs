title: The Blockchain Developer Bootcamp
---

Originally designed, written, maintained and executed by Consensys Software,
the Blockchain Developer Bootcamp is a well-known and much-loved resource and
curriculum.
Hundreds of graduates from the course went on to careers across web3, subsequently
benefitting thousands more who learned from those graduates, and millions of users
of their projects.

Consensys handed off the Bootcamp curriculum to Education DAO in early 2024. The DAO
plans to execute on Consensys' original plan: to take what should be an unopinionated,
dynamic educational resource out of a for-profit company, and make it web3 technical
education for the people, by the people.

If you're interested in editing, updating, writing new content, helping manage the
community of students or teaching the students or even _being_ a student, we'd love to
have your contributions.
