Key points:

- IPFS stand for the Inter-planetary file system
- Hashes in IPFS start with "Qm..."
- The [js-ipfs library](https://js.ipfs.io/) allows you to use IPFS without having to run a local IPFS node
- It aims to replace HTTP by addressing file content (with hashes) rather than file locations
- It uses p2p protocols, making it a decentralized network
- It complements blockchain nicely, as it allows immutable, off-chain data storage
- Other benefits include bandwidth saving for servers, potential content availability improvements, censorship and deletion resistance and data deduplication
