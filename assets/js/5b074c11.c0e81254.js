This means that, even if the largest corporation or government were to focus every available resource into figuring out a certain individual\'s private key, they will not be able to do it. Isn\'t that crazy!? This asymmetric power imbalance is so dramatic that in the 1990s, world governments fought against the use of public key cryptography. The argument was, because public key cryptography essentially cannot be broken, it represented a critical threat to the national security of governments like the United States.

That is, how do actors in a network we coordinate and agree on the series of events that have led to the current state of the network?

Hyperledger Besu is actually part of a bundled suite of Ethereum protocol clients called ConsenSys Quorum, which consists of Hyperledger Besu and GoQuorum, private key managers, consensus mechanisms, transaction managers, APIs, plugins, libraries, deployment tools, etc. In this tutorial, we are going to walk you through how the client works, and take some detours to explain concepts in detail.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S02-ethereum/M5-installing-geth/index":{"id":"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S02-ethereum/M5-installing-geth/index","title":"index","description":"Setting up Geth","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S02-ethereum/M6-Installing-besu/index":{"id":"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S02-ethereum/M6-Installing-besu/index","title":"Install a Full Besu Node using Bonsai Storage on Ubuntu Server","description":"Who is this guide for","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S03-smart-contracts/M1-mental-model/L1-mental-model-sc/index":{"id":"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S03-smart-contracts/M1-mental-model/L1-mental-model-sc/index","title":"Where Do Smart Contracts Fit in Our Mental Model?","description":"In this chapter, we\'re going to dive deeper into smart contracts: What they are, how they work and how you can build with them safely.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S03-smart-contracts/M2-intro-to-truffle/L1-background/index":{"id":"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S03-smart-contracts/M2-intro-to-truffle/L1-background/index","title":"index","description":"Before we go into the Solidity section, we want to make sure you have a place where you can play around with the Solidity code you\'re starting to learn.

You can trade against the AMM\'s capital in the smart contract instead of between peers. It uses the trades to update the size of the assets and update their price accordingly. The AMM can always guarantee liquidity by raising the price for an asset according to market demand.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S05a-defi/M5c-rfqs/L1/index":{"id":"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S05a-defi/M5c-rfqs/L1/index","title":"Request for Quote","description":"When to use which tool","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S05a-defi/M6-oracles/L1/index":{"id":"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S05a-defi/M6-oracles/L1/index","title":"Oracles in DeFi","description":"Oracles are an essential part of DeFi since finance cannot exist in a vacuum without information. Oracles are bridges between a blockchain and the real world. They are used as queriable on-chain APIs to get information into smart contracts. The data could be anything from price information, weather reports, random numbers or more. Oracles can also be bi-directional and can \\"send\\" data out to the real world. They are further described here.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S05a-defi/M7-defi-lending/L1/index":{"id":"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S05a-defi/M7-defi-lending/L1/index","title":"DeFi Lending Markets","description":"The Use of Lending Markets","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S05a-defi/M8-governance/L1/index":{"id":"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S05a-defi/M8-governance/L1/index","title":"What are Governance Tokens","description":"Decentralized networks have no central entity to manage them. Governance tokens were created to help the community steer the network. Governance tokens represent a percentage of voting power, called \u201cpro-rata voting rights\u201d, over a protocol or network. These tokens typically have code that embeds rules related to how the system can change, like adjusting configurations or adding new components. The ability to adjust a network is essential because DeFi protocols need to stay in sync and react to changing market conditions. It also allows the network to evolve as the ecosystem matures.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S05a-defi/M9-swaps/L1/index":{"id":"courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp/S05a-defi/M9-swaps/L1/index","title":"Introduction to MetaMask Swaps","description":"The previous section covered decentralized exchanges and briefly touched upon aggregators, which finds the best price between exchanges.

The Graph organizes and makes it easy to query on-chain data in a way that was not possible in the past, with GraphQL. Querying blockchain data is difficult. Node clients can be inconsistent, application developers are required to write proprietary code and build centralized servers for ingesting the data, and they need to manage their own APIs for uptime and optimal UX. The Graph aims to solve this problem by abstracting the back-end, pre-aggregate data and making it significantly more efficient for developers to retrieve on-chain data.
