We just need to set the web3 provider for the contract, which we can do with `simpleStorage.setProvider(web3.givenProvider)`. Now we can use this contract object to interact with the deployed contract.\n\n![](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/205430/images/c20/2ce/faf/1595392171288.jpg)\n\nYou will need some Rinkeby ETH to pay for gas to interact with the contract. You can get some via this link: [https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet](https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet).\n\n## Read the contract state\n\nLet\'s read the current value of the storedData. Since our contract object is saved as simpleStorage, run `simpleStorage.methods.get().call().then(console.log)`. This will print the current storedData value of the contract. Since this is just reading the contract, there is no transaction sent to the network and there is no cost associated with this action.\n\n## Update the contract state\n\nWe update the contract by sending it a transaction to the "set()" function with the desired parameter. This action does cost gas, since we need to update the state of the contract on all of the network nodes. Feel free to update the value to whatever you want. `simpleStorage.methods.set(SET_YOUR_NEW_NUMBER_HERE).send({from: web3.givenProvider.selectedAddress})`\n\nRunning this code should trigger Metamask to ask you to sign a transaction.\xa0\n\nOnce the transaction is mined, you can check for the transaction with simpleStorage.methods.get().call().then(console.log) or you can check the contract on a Rinkeby block explorer [like the one here.](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x49bb098e781ed5c50d85e82d85cba1a6f03fd3e6)\n\n## Watch for events\n\nYou can easily subscribe to events with simpleStorage. Notice we have a "storageUpdate" event in the contract.\n\nTo listen for that event, run `simpleStorage.events.storageUpdate(function(error, event){console.log(event)})`\n\n[Here is a link to the relevant web3.js documentation for subscribing to events.](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-contract.html#events)\n\nTo trigger this event, you will have to call the "set()" function on the contract again. Once the update transaction is mined, the event will fire. This is what it looks like in the browser console.\n\n![](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/205430/images/964/e04/26d/1595392170831.jpg)\n\nThis should give you a good overview of how to connect to a contract and interact with it using web3.js\n'})})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},8453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>i,x:()=>c});var o=n(6540);const a={},s=o.createContext(a);function i(e){const t=o.useContext(s);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function c(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:i(e.components),o.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
